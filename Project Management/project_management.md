# Project Management

To effectively manage the RADIAN project's timeline and deliverables, a detailed project plan was initially developed and tracked using Microsoft Excel. This spreadsheet-based approach allowed for flexible input of tasks, start/end dates, durations, and dependencies, particularly useful during the iterative phases of hardware and software development. Key milestones, such as the Early and Late Stage Gateway reports, the pilot session with the England U20 Lacrosse team, and the final report submission, were clearly demarcated within this plan. For visual representation and inclusion in this report, the core task data and timeline information were then exported and used to generate the Gantt chart in this folder. This visual chart provides a clear overview of the project's phased execution, task scheduling, and critical path towards completion.
