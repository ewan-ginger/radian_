# Project Reflection

This project provided a rare opportunity to bring together a broad range of design engineering skills developed throughout my time at Imperial. From early-stage prototyping to machine learning and stakeholder engagement, the work demanded a multidisciplinary approach—and it was deeply rewarding to apply so many aspects of what I’ve learned in a single, cohesive output.

Revisiting the initial benchmarks—keeping the build under £50, under 55 grams, and achieving at least 92% F1 score on action recognition—offered a clear lens for evaluation. Reaching a build cost of around £30 and a final device weight of 25 grams felt like a genuine high point, especially when the 3D-printed housing slotted cleanly onto a standard lacrosse shaft, exactly as intended. That sense of translating a digital concept into a precise physical outcome echoed many of the rapid prototyping and CAD exercises I’d practised during my degree.

On the analytics side, achieving approximately 95% accuracy for isolated action detection was a strong validation of the machine-learning pipeline I developed. It drew directly on the technical foundations laid during data science and computing modules. However, the process also exposed areas for improvement—specifically, the automated labelling workflow introduced more “null” windows than expected, often due to actions occurring in close succession. In hindsight, I recognise that I moved too quickly from labelling to model training, and would now spend more time fine-tuning the segmentation thresholds. Balancing speed of development with rigour in validation is a key lesson I’ll take forward.

The technical range of the project meant constantly shifting gears. CAD and form development felt second nature; designing the butt-cap in Fusion 360 and iterating it rapidly was a familiar process. In contrast, firmware and embedded systems required learning on the fly. I had limited experience working at that level of hardware abstraction, so optimising the ESP32’s sleep modes and setting up hardware interrupts was a steep learning curve. Debugging power issues made me realise that app-level prototyping skills don’t always translate smoothly to embedded development—but the challenge was incredibly valuable.

On the machine learning front, building and training a Convolutional Neural Network pushed me to explore new tools like TensorFlow and experiment with techniques such as stratified cross-validation. Watching the model improve was satisfying, but I noticed a tendency to over-optimise—pursuing marginal gains without always asking whether the added complexity was meaningful. Going forward, I’ll set more disciplined performance thresholds and aim to simplify rather than overfit.

Beyond the technical work, the project gave me the chance to practise user research and product thinking in context. My training in user-centred design was particularly useful when gathering feedback from lacrosse players—turning those insights into tangible design improvements for the housing was a great example of design iteration grounded in real user needs. At the same time, trying to optimise the power budget exposed clear limitations in my understanding of electronics. Interpreting datasheets and modelling power draw didn’t come easily, and it’s an area I now plan to actively improve. I’m hoping to take on a smaller personal project—perhaps a basic wearable step counter—that will give me a focused way to learn about PCB design, battery selection, and current estimation without the overhead of a large codebase.

In many ways, this project felt like a culmination of my time at Imperial—it challenged me to integrate design, engineering, data, and human factors in a way that mirrored real-world product development. The variety of skills required made it especially enjoyable. To keep improving, I’ve already planned to refactor sections of the codebase into a more maintainable pipeline and conduct extended field tests—such as multi-stick scrimmages—to stress-test the system under more chaotic conditions. I’m also aiming to improve how I present results to non-technical stakeholders, using clearer visualisations and focusing on trade-offs rather than raw metrics.

Ultimately, RADIAN reminded me what I enjoy most about design engineering: the chance to solve meaningful problems by drawing on a wide and varied toolkit. It reinforced that successful products emerge not just from technical excellence, but from iterative thinking, user insight, and a willingness to keep learning across disciplines.
